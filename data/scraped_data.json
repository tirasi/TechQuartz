    "content": "Standard Ebooks: Free and liberated ebooks, carefully produced for the true book lover Free and liberated ebooks, carefully produced for the true book lover. Standard Ebooks is a volunteer-driven project that produces new editions of public domain ebooks that are lovingly formatted, open source, free of U.S. copyright restrictions, and free of cost. Ebook projects like Project Gutenberg transcribe ebooks and make them available for the widest number of reading devices. Standard Ebooks takes ebooks from sources like Project Gutenberg, formats and typesets them using a carefully designed and professional-grade style manual, fully proofreads and corrects them, and then builds them to create a new edition that takes advantage of state-of-the-art ereader and browser technology. Standard Ebooks aren’t just a beautiful addition to your digital library—they’re a high quality standard to build your own ebooks on. Browse our library of free ebooks What makes Standard Ebooks different? Modern & consistent typography Other free ebooks don’t put much effort into professional-quality typography: they use \"straight\" quotes instead of “curly” quotes, they ignore details like em- and en-dashes, and they look more like early-90’s web pages instead of actual books. Standard Ebooks applies a rigorous and modern style manual when developing each and every ebook to ensure they meet a professional-grade and consistent typographical standard. Our ebooks look good . Full proofing with careful corrections Transcriptions from other sources are often filled with typos or suffer from issues like inconsistent spelling, missing accent marks, or missing punctuation. Submitting corrections to such sources can be difficult or impossible, so errors are rarely fixed. At Standard Ebooks, we do a careful and complete readthrough of each ebook before releasing it, checking it against a scan of the original pages to fix as many typos as possible. Even if we do miss something, our ebooks are stored in the hugely popular Git source control system, allowing anyone to easily submit a correction. Rich & detailed metadata Our ebooks include complete, well-researched, and consistent metadata, including original, detailed book blurbs and links to encyclopedia sources. Perfect for machine processing or for extra-curious, technically-minded readers. State-of-the-art technology Each Standard Ebook takes full advantage of the latest ereader technology, including: Hyphenation support, Popup footnotes, High-resolution and scalable vector graphics, Ereader-compatible tables of contents, and more. One of our goals is to ensure our ebooks stay up-to-date with the best reading experience technology can provide. Just because it’s a classic doesn’t mean it has to use old technology. Quality covers Everyone knows a book is judged by its cover, but most free ebooks leave it to your ereader software to generate a drab default cover. Standard Ebooks draws from a vast collection of public domain fine art to create attractive, unique, appropriate, and consistent covers for each of our ebooks. Clean code & semantic markup Our strict coding standards allow technologists and ebook producers to use Standard Ebooks files as reliable, easy to read, and robust bases for their own work—not to mention as models of what well-crafted ebook files look like. Common code patterns are repeated through different ebooks, so the code never surprises you. Each ebook is also enhanced with careful standards-based semantic markup that opens the gateway for exciting new kinds of machine processing. Free, open-source, & public domain We use the popular Git source control system to track each and every change made to our ebooks. Anyone can easily see a history of changes, or contribute their own changes with the click of a mouse. And while all of the ebooks we feature and the cover art we draw from are already believed to be in the public domain in the U.S., Standard Ebooks releases all of the work we put in to each ebook into the public domain too. That makes each and every one of our ebook files not just free, but libre too—because the world deserves more unrestricted culture."

NDLI-Club is a platform for conducting learning-oriented events, both online (both local as well as involving many other institutes) and offline, for students of an institute using contents of NDLI (and others as well) and engaging experts (of the institute as well as external) to deliver talks or conduct sessions. Examples of online events are webinars by experts on specific topics or on examination preparation strategy. Examples of offline events are quiz sessions or debate competitions. The benefit is to facilitate learning among students through activities. Online events can be conducted through the NDLI-Club platform itself without need of any other service. Once an institute gets registered in the NDLI-Club portal ( https://club.ndl.iitkgp.ac.in ) and makes its students members of the NDLI-Club, the institute gets a Registration No. which will be visible in the NDLI-Club portal ( https://club.ndl.iitkgp.ac.in ). And once the institute conducts events in its NDLI-Club, it gets Institutional Registration Certificate and students get Event Participation Certificate. Please follow these steps for setting up NDLI-Club at your institute. Please look at the FAQ if you have any query.

About Us EPFO ranks among the globe's premier Social Security Organizations, distinguished by its vast clientele and the magnitude of financial transactions it manages. At present it maintains 29.88 crore accounts ( Annual Report 2022-23 ) pertaining to its members. The inception of the Employees' Provident Fund dates back to the enactment of the Employees' Provident Funds Ordinance on November 15, 1951, which was subsequently replaced by the Employees' Provident Funds Act of 1952. This legislative journey began with the introduction of the Employees' Provident Funds Bill in Parliament as Bill Number 15 of 1952, aimed at establishing provident funds for employees across factories and other establishments. Over time, this legislation evolved into the Employees' Provident Funds & Miscellaneous Provisions Act of 1952 , applicable nationwide in India. The administration of this Act and its associated schemes falls under the purview of a tripartite body known as the Central Board of Trustees (CBT) , Employees' Provident Fund.

The Board is assisted by the Employees’ PF Organization (EPFO), consisting 147 offices across the country ( EPFO's Organisation Structure ).The EPFO is under the administrative control of the Ministry of Labour & Employment, Government of India ( click here 14-07-2015 ).
